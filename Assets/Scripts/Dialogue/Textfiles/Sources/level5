Brute: NOOOO!!! MY BRAWN!!!
Sammy: The Brute exhaustedly collapses into a puddle of sweat. No chance for a one-liner this time. u_u
Hannah: ouch, i feel seen. alright, i make my way back down the exit staircase.
Sammy: You arrive in a vast torchlit room full of piles of gold and treasure. It's the motherlode!
Hannah: GOLD!
Sammy: As you step into the room, the gate behind you closes. You notice a familiar knight standing before you, and approach tentatively.
Knight: Hasty hare of Hemiquaver! So you have made it past the other Beasts. Perhaps I underestimated you.
Ha'na: balthazar? how did you get down here so fast?
Sammy: He draws his sword with a SCHWINK.
Ha'na: hey, now. i won our duel fair and square.
Sammy: Without warning, you hear the gate behind you SLAM open. Quickly you turn, and see the three Beasts from above enter the room.
Ghost: hi again jerkwad,,,, *sniff* >_<
Jester: Fwa-ha~ We're back and ready to attack!
Brute: HELLO.
Ha'na: big guy, didn't i just beat you??
Brute: POWER NAP.
Ha'na: h-hey, balthazar, let's team up and split the treasure! two-on-three isn't great, but we'll have a chance!
Jester: Fwo-ho-ho-hoo~!! Two-on-three? Oh naur naur naur~! The fight you're in is one-on-four!!
Hannah: ??? 
Hannah: i turn to look at balthazar ???
Sammy: Pointing his golden sword at your head, he flips up his visor, revealing two glowing red eyes in an inky blackness.
Ha'na: you're the fourth Beast??
Ghost: yeah, dummy, take that!!! >w<
Knight: I am the Lord of the Highclaw Plains Beast Dungeon. And as I told you: no one will rob me of my rightful spoils.
Knight: You have fought honorably, hare! It is now time for you to die honorably.
Hannah: i draw my sword. with a SCHWINK.
Ha'na: i've beat you all before. i can do it. ... again.
Sammy: Okay, here we go. Roll with disadvantage, and we'll get into... Preset... 5...
