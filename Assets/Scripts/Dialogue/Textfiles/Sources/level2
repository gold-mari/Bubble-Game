Sammy: Exhausted and with his armor bent out of shape, Balthazar the BrassÃ¨d staggers back, leaning on his sword like a cane.
Knight: You are. Stronger. Then I thought.
Hannah: i don't give him the satisfaction of a response.
Sammy: Ice cold, Hannah! Alright, so you leave Balthazar behind and walk into the DUNGEON. 
Sammy: As the gate THUDs behind you, you find yourself in a room lit by thousands of flickering blue candles.
Hannah: blue...
Sammy: Suddenly, a poltergeist in [OUTFIT] descends through the ceiling. It gently lifts you off the ground.
Ghost: waAAAAaaAAAaaaaa!!! oh hey you're new
Ghost: are- *sniff* are you an adventurer too :(((
Ha'na: ... i'm here to fix the plumbing.
Ghost: you don't have any tools ... also Beasts don't need to use the toilets ...
Ha'na: shit.
Ghost: no we don't do that
Ghost: anyway it's very mean to lie ::>_<:: adventurers make me so sad!!! *sniff* they always lie to me and it just makes it a really hostile work environment,,,
Sammy: WHUNK! The poltergeist slams you against the ceiling using its ghosty gravity magic.
Hannah: whunk
Sammy: Oh, fuck off.
Hannah: whunk off
Ghost: anyway i have to kill you now, boss's orders sorryyy /_ \ don't worry it'll be quick
Ha'na: not so fast!
