Ghost: no no no no no!!!! come on!!!! (T^T) i swear if i get written up for this,, >_<
Ha'na: consider yourself... busted...
Ghost: that wasn't even a good line!........
Sammy: Bursting into tears, the poltergeist floats back up through the ceiling. A line of candles illuminates the way down with a FWOOSH.
Hannah: ok, i head downstairs. also fwoosh haha
Sammy: You can't mock all of my onomatopoeias! They're all I have. :'<
Hannah: no that's not true, you also have the world record for being the shortest-
Sammy: ANYWAY AS YOU ENTER FLOOR two, you find yourself in a room of white walls illuminated by colored spotlights.
Sammy: A small disco-ball spins in the center of the room; underneath sits what appears to be a clown wearing a polka-dotted wizard hat.
Jester: Fwa-ha! So you defeated our precious poltergeist on floor one; but you'll see STARS when I'm done~!
Ha'na: and who are you?
Jester: The wizard-class-clown of the Highclaw crew! Also, pit boss Beast on floor number two~!
Ha'na: do you rehearse these???
Jester: My magic demands me to rhyme all the time. I've practiced! I'll still blow your ass sky high!!
Ha'na: that was a stretch.
Jester: Oh no, bunny, that's wrong, I fear! The REAL stretch is that HAT over your ears! Fwo-ho-ho~!! >:3
Hannah: i shed a single solitary tear and pull out my sword.
Ha'na: you'll pay for that one... i swear it...
Sammy: The jester laughs a "FWA-HA" and readies a magic bomb, rainbow energy gathering between their palms. Lemme load up Preset 3...
