Jester: OUGH! Rough.
Hannah: i took you down! ... clown.
Jester: I'll take defeat with grace~! Now get outta my face!! Fwa-ha!
Sammy: With squeaky steps, the Jester shows you the door, before vanishing in a plume of rainbow smoke.
Sammy: When you get to the next floor, you're surprised to see a gym full of weight machines. Off in the corner, a hulking mountain of a Beast in [OUTFIT] works a bench press.
Brute: I SEE YOU, PIPSQUEAK. I'LL DEAL WITH YOU AFTER MY SET. STAY PUT.
Ha'na: um. sounds good man!
Hannah: are there any exits in the room that i can see?
Sammy: Ooh. Uhm, yes there is! You can clearly see the exit on the other side of the room. :3c
Hannah: alright, i make a mad dash for the exit. super inconspicuous.
Sammy: Super inconspicuous. You make it just about halfway down the stairs before you get picked up by the scruff and flipped around.
Brute: RUDE LITTLE RUNT. I SAID STAY PUT.
Ha'na: i- uh- didn't want to distract you?
Brute: YOU DID.
Sammy: The big guy carries you up the stairs and drops you unceremoniously to the ground with a FLOOMPH.
Hannah: and not a fwoosh?
Sammy: I Swear To God I'm Gonna Strangle You Hannah.
Ha'na: so... is there any way we could talk this out?
Brute: NOT SO GOOD AT TALKING. BETTER AT FIGHTING. AND MUSCLE!
Sammy: To demonstrate this, he pops his pecs, flexes his biceps, and grunts.
Hannah: thank you for not actually grunting, Sammy. i appreciate your restraint.
Sammy: OOGH. UNGH. PREPARING PRESET 4. OONGH.
